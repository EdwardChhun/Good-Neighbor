1. Make sure, you're on the ./py_server directory
2. Set up the virtual env $ venv/Scripts/activate
3. Have packages installed, 
    python -m pip install google-cloud-vision 
    python -m pip install Flask
4. run Python main.py and connect to http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/detect

Use Case:

Have main.py running in background for image recognition to match two posts with the same labels

I've included some pictures in py_server\image-test that should have a normal and a -found tag, they have the same labels
